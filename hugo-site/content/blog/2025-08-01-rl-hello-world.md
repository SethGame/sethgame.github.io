## Why
- In order to gain an introductory knowledge of utilizing an RL algorithm interfacing with the FlexSim model

## How
- Read the .readme text files for each of the corresponding Python files to understand how they worked
- Ran each consecutive Python file as outlined in the tutorial to see them in action
- Installed the corresponding package versions for the programs to run

## So What
- Completing this guide on the HelloWorld allows me to engage in more complex features of this style of project, and also gain insights into using tools to help me along the way.
- For example, the use of the Tensorboard extension allows us to see the different parameter results for the training of the model
